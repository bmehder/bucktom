      <h4>Estimating the cost of tree removal</h4>
      <p>
        Whenever you have a need for tree service or tree removal people often
        wonder how we come up with the complete tree removal cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because we offer free estimates, we come to your property, meet with
        you, and analyze your need for tree removal service.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will be looking at the amount of tree cutting or tree pruning work we
        will need to do to determine the cost of tree removal. The cost is
        determined on the amount of equipment, the level of exposure and danger,
        and how long it will take to safely complete your job including complete
        cleanup of the affected area.

        You can expect a turnkey quote and agreed upon day to perform work
        unless weather forces us to reschedule by BuckTom Services, LLC.

      <h4>How to get quality lawn care</h4>
      <p>
        Grounds maintenance for commercial/residential properties is best
        obtained by hiring a competent lawn care company with experience and
        well-trained employees.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lawn maintenance company must be insured and properly licensed. It
        is important that one of itâ€™s landscapers holds a NC Pesticide License
        to ensure proper grass care and weed-free beds.
      </p>
      <p>
        A good company will know the proper grass cutting height for mowing.
        That company should also know fertilizer analysis, mulch depth, and
        quality edging methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Commercial lawn care is a year-round service requiring seasonal
        attention for lawn mowing, shrub pruning, leaf removal, snow removal,
        and mulching.
      </p>
      <p>BuckTom Services, LLC is that company.</p>
